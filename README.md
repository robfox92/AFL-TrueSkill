# AFL-TrueSkill
This is a script to produce TrueSkill ratings from AFL Match results.
It generates a unique player ID based on their date of birth and name
Skill is calculated with the TrueSkill algorithm (www.trueskill.org for docs)

The iPython notebook performs all the data massaging, it only requires the aflstats_2006_2016.csv file to be in the same folder
The csv needs to be compressed to be pushed to GitHub
